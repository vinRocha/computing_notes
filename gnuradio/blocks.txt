GNURadio Blocks’ Working Principles


Packed to Unpacked:

Takes an input stream of ints (32bits per item) or shorts (16bits per item) or
bytes (8bits per item) and transforms it in an output stream of the same type,
but with less bits per item, specified in the field “Bits per Chunk”. You can
also set the endianness of the output items (default is MSB). As an example, if
you connect a stream of bits in this block, and set “Bits per Chunk = 1”, the
output will be a stream of bytes with ether 0 or 1. The endianness is related to
the input stream and not the output. For instance, in the above case regardless
the input values, the outputs will either be 0x00 0x01;

This block increases the rate of output items (samp_rate).


Unpacked to Packed:

This block does the opposite of the block above. It takes a unpacked stream of X
“Bits per Chunk”, reads and groups these bits according to the endianness
(default: MSB) and produces a new stream of packed bits.

This block reduces the rate of output items (samp_rate).


QT GUI Time Sink:

It handles the samples based in the input stream. It doesn’t care about the
sample rate. It actually uses the parameters “Sample Rate” and “Number of
Points” to calculate the scale of the output graph. Tmax = “Number of Points”/
“Sample Rate”. Each point represents one sample of the input stream.
